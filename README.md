**Build and print your own calendar**

I like to print-out a schedule for repeatitive tasks that I'm planning to do over the next month. The format I prefer is a calendar you could print-out at http://print-a-calendar.com. And then each day I write down those tasks which I've completed. I can then measure streaks and also keep track of where I'm irregular. I've found this a very helpful learning method - see [Seinfelds' technique].

Since I know what tasks I'm going to aim for, an empty calendar is good, but it would be better if the tasks were already written out with a checkbox next to it.

This is what the calendar builder does. It lets you define tasks in a text file similar to below:

```
start-date: 2017-05-01
end-date: 2017-06-01

run: everyday
learn russian: everyday
effec java: everyday
discip of prog: everyday
security graham: everyday
geb: everyday
strength: weekdays->monday, wednesday
harmonica: weekdays->tuesday, thursday
```

And then generates a calendar like the one below:
